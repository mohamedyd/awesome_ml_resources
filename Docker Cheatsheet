In this doument, I list the important resources and commands for learning containers.

|Bash Command|Details|
|```Sudo getent group```|The getent command is used to retrieve information from various databases on a system, including the system password database, group database, hostname database, and service name database.

getent group will output a list of all groups on the system, along with their associated group IDs and member users.|
|```Sudo usermod -aG docker sag```|adds the user "sag" to the docker group on a Linux system, giving them permission to run Docker commands without using sudo.

* usermod: The usermod command is used to modify user account details on a Linux system.
* -aG docker: The -a option specifies that we want to add the user to a group, rather than replacing their current group memberships. The G option specifies the name of the group we want to add the user to, which in this case is docker.|
