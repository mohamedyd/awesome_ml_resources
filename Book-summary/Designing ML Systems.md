| 11      | Infrastructure abstraction   | • It is difficult for data scientists to equally focus on model development and on model deployment. <br>• However, there are several drawbacks for splitting the team into ML engineers and DevOps engineers:<br>    - Communication and coordination overhead<br>    - Debugging challenges: when trying to figure out where the failures come from<br>    - Finger-pointing: each team might think it's another team's responsibility to fix the failures<br>    - Narrow context: no one has visibility into the entire process to optimize it<br>• A solution to this dilemma is to allow data scientists to own the entire process end-to-end without having to worry about the infrastructure:<br>    - What if I can tell the tool, "Here where I store my data (S3), here are the steps to run my code (featurization, modeling), here's where my code should run (EC2 instances, serverless stuff like AWS Batch, Functions, etc.), here's what my code needs to run at each step (dependencies)," and then this tool manages all the infrastructure stuff for the data scientist.<br>• Can we use large language models to generate configuration files for each infrastructure generated by such a tool? | • MLOps templates, e.g., <br>Cookiecutter template for MLOps<br>• MLOps Guide<br>• DagsHub / Cookiecutter-MLOps<br>    - A reasonably standardized but flexible project structure that implements sound MLOps principles for building your next machine learning project <br>    - It includes only DVC<br>• mlops-generator 1.0.1 <br>    - CLI for MLOps code generator |
