This is where Sonar's AI Code Assurance comes into play. We provide comprehensive solutions spanning SonarQube for IDE, SonarQube Server, and SonarQube Cloud, designed to integrate seamlessly into your development workflow. These tools automatically analyze code for issues, enforce coding standards, and guide developers in remediating problems effectively.

* [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban): Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to: (1) Easily switch between different coding agents, (2) Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence, (3) Quickly review work and start dev servers, (4) Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on, and (5) Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
