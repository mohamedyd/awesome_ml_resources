Reading Notes and Slides from Chip Huyen's CS 392S(Machine Learning Systems Design) (https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)

💹Taking Made with ML course by Goku Mohandas - the course focuses on both theory and hands-on, It includes a hands-on explanation of concepts and tools such as Testing Data, Code and Model, Optuna's Hyperparameter Tuning, REST API, CI/CD using Github Actions, Feature Store and Monitoring (https://madewithml.com/#mlops)

💹Last but Important - Learning about any Cloud system and deploying a project with Docker on Cloud. It is more important since, in most real-world systems, you will be deploying projects in the cloud, and having beforehand experience will give you an edge when you work on a real-time project for the first time
