# Reinforcement Learning


## RL Books


* (Introduction to Reinforcement Learning, Free-ebook)[http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html]: The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.
