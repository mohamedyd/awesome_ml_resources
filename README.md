Welcome to the `Awesome ML Resources` repo!

As a machine learning enthusiast, I understand how challenging it can be to find reliable and comprehensive resources related to ML, MLOps, Python, XAI, RL, and other learning resources. That's why I have compiled a comprehensive list of the best resources out there to make it easier for you to navigate the world of machine learning and beyond.

Whether you're a beginner looking to get started in the field or an experienced practitioner searching for advanced techniques and tools, you'll find something valuable in this repository.

üîç Here's a sneak peek at what you'll find:

üëâ Plenty of resources about Generative AI (GenAI) and AI Code Assistants

üëâ A curated list of top ML and MLOps resources

üëâ An extensive collection of Python libraries and frameworks

üëâ The latest developments in explainable AI and reinforcement learning

üëâ A wide range of learning resources, including books, tutorials, videos, and blogs
