## Domain-specific Coding with LLMs

* [A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03981?): The survey provides a systematic review of the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in Domain-Specfic Languages. The survey categorizes the methods used for LLM improvement into six main groups and summarized the novel methods and architectures proposed by the researchers. 

* [On the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Domain-Specific Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01639): The study demonstrates that LLMs exhibit sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code, due to their limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries. We further observe that incorporating API knowledge as prompts can empower LLMs to generate more professional code.

## General Coding with LLMs 

* [Paradigm shift on Coding Productivity Using GenAI (2025)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18404?): Through surveys and interviews with industrial domain-experts, the authors identify primary productivity-influencing factors, including task complexity, coding skills, domain knowledge, and GenAI integration. The findings indicate that GenAI tools enhance productivity in routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited context-awareness of codebases and insufficient support for customized design rules.

* [A Survey on Large Language Models for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00515): The survey, published in 2024, categorizes and discusses the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications.

* [A Survey of Large Language Models for Code: Evolution, Benchmarking, and Future Trends](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10372): The survey, published in 2024, addresses three
questions: (1) What LLMs are specifically designed for software engineering tasks, and their relationship? (2) Do Code LLMs outperform general LLMs in software engineering tasks? (3) Which LLMs are more proficient in different software engineering tasks? 

* [Code LLMs: A Taxonomy-based Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08291): this survey, published in 2024, offers insights into the current state and future directions of LLMs in coding tasks, including their applications and limitations.
