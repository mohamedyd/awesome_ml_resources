## Domain-specific Coding with LLMs

* [A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03981?): The survey provides a systematic review of the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in Domain-Specfic Languages. The survey categorizes the methods used for LLM improvement into six main groups and summarized the novel methods and architectures proposed by the researchers.  

## General Coding with LLMs 

* [Paradigm shift on Coding Productivity Using GenAI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18404?): Through surveys and interviews with industrial domain-experts, we identify primary productivity-influencing factors, including task complexity, coding skills, domain knowledge, and GenAI integration. Our findings indicate that GenAI tools enhance productivity in routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited context-awareness of codebases and insufficient support for customized design rules.
