* [CSE333: Systems Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse333/): Includes substantial programming experience in languages that expose machine characteristics and low-level data representation (e.g., C and C++); explicit memory management; interacting with operating-system services; and cache-aware programming. Prerequisite: CSE 351.

* [EE382V  Technology for Embedded Internet of Things](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyg2vmIzGxXEISCVuYejQF1EnH2iPnwgn): The focus of this class will be low-level technology to implement IoT devices. By exposing fundamental operational behavior, students, when facing a design problem, will be empowered to either select an appropriate existing technology, or to develop new technologies.
