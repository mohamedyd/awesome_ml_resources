* [Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://interpretable-ml-class.github.io/): This course  covers latest research on understanding large language models (e.g., GPT-3) and diffusion models (e.g., DALLE 2), and highlight the unique opportunities and challenges that arise when interpreting the behavior of such large generative models. 

* [A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable (Free ebook)](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/): the focus of the book is on model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models such as feature importance and accumulated local effects, and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME. In addition, the book presents methods specific to deep neural networks.
